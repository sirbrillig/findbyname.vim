*findbyname.txt* plugin for finding files with a split window

FindByName         version 1.1

Adds a command to search a directory for files and outputs the results into a
split window. I was frustrated by the inability to output the results of vim's
built-in |find| into a searchable list and to easily search in a specific
directory.

Note that this will only work on a Unix-like system such as Linux or the MacOS
where the system command 'find' is available.

USAGE                                                          *FindByNameUsage*

This plugin adds the command FindByName which takes one or two arguments. The
first argument is a filename or part of a filename and the second is a path. In
both cases, the path is optional and will default to '.'.

To search for filenames containing the word 'foo' in the path ~/stuff/, use
*FindByName* like so:

  :FindByName foo ~/stuff/

CONFIGURATION                                          *FindByNameConfiguration*

The plugin will default to opening the files it finds in a new buffer, but you
can set the option FindByName_Use_Tabs to 'true' to use a new tab instead.

  let FindByName_Use_Tabs = 'true'
